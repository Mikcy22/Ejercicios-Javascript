  /*
  His Royal Highness Prince of Edinburgh cares a lot about the ecology and propagates 
  waste sorting. Once per year, He organizes the Christmas Trash Party, where His employees 
  sort the garbage that the Prince has been thrown during the year. Obviously, you want 
  to participate in this High day.

Task
You will receive trash1 and trash2, that might be the next values:

[], false, '', new Array(), null, NaN, undefined, 0, -0, 0n, -0n, '0'

You have to return a boolean if they are strictly equal.

However
The Prince says when He was young, there weren't softies who were afraid 
to get their hands dirty, so He doesn't let His employees use gloves for 
work (triple equals === and strict inequality !== are not allowed).
